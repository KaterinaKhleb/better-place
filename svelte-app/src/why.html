	<h2>For a few reasons:</h2> 
	<ul> 
	<li> 
	<strong> Toxic polution.</strong> 
	Not separated waste will get all mixed eventually, 
	which will result in chemical reaction between the components and will lead 
	to contaminating ground water and realease explosive methane gas. 
	
	</li> 
	<li> 
	<strong>Methane</strong>, which is a green house gas, which ultimately leads 
	to climate change, extreme climates and droughts. We 
	can see the impact already in the world. 
	</li> 
	<li> 
	<strong>Segregation protects health.</strong> When ragpickers put 
	their hands into the waste to clean it up, it results in 
	cuts that further leads to infections, resulting in 
	deterioration of health. 
	
	</li> 
	<li> 
	<strong>Economy of the country.</strong>When the waste is not separated properly it leads to 
	less recycling because it is not easy to remove materials 
	for recycling. This means many resources are wasted.
